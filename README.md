Fortune Cookies!
=============

This is an example of simple OOJS created live with the help of DBC students on 2014.10.12 at [DBC](http://devbootcamp.com/).

The fortune cookie object could easily be exported by rearranging the definition of the constructor function from

    function FortuneCookie (el) { ...
    
to

    FortuneCookie = function (el) { ...

Enjoy!
